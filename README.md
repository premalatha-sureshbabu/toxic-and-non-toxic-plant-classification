Toxic plants can be classified based on how they cause harm, such as through ingestion, contact, or photosensitization, while non-toxic plants are generally safe to handle or consume. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown: Toxic Plant Classifications: Poisonous to Eat: Some plants contain toxins that are harmful or even deadly when ingested. 
Poisonous Upon Contact: Certain plants can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, or other adverse effects upon contact. 
Photosensitization: Some plants contain compounds that, when exposed to sunlight, can cause skin burns or rashes. 
Airborne Allergies: Certain plants can produce pollen or other airborne particles that cause allergic reactions in some individuals. 
Examples of Toxic Plants: Poison Ivy, Oak, and Sumac: These plants contain an oil called urushiol that can cause severe skin rashes. 
Giant Hogweed: This plant can cause severe skin burns and blistering upon contact. 
Poison Hemlock: This plant is highly toxic and can be fatal if ingested. Datura, Nerium, Digitalis, Asclepius, Atropa, Abrus, Adenium, Ephedra, or Convallaria majalis: These plants can be cardiotoxic. 
Senecio, Crotalaria: These plants can be hepatotoxic. 
Non-Toxic Plants: Many common houseplants and garden plants are considered non-toxic and safe to handle or consume.
Examples include: Forsythia, Impatiens, Inch plant (Tradescantia fluminesis). 
Important Considerations: "Poisonous" vs. "Toxic": While all poisonous plants are toxic, not all toxic plants are poisonous.
A toxic plant can cause harm through various means, such as skin irritation or inhalation, while a poisonous plant is specifically dangerous if ingested. 
Individual Sensitivities: Some individuals may be more sensitive to certain plants than others, even if they are generally considered non-toxic. 
Always Exercise Caution: When in doubt, it's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid handling or consuming any plant that you are unsure about. 
Consult Experts: If you have any concerns about plant toxicity, consult with a local expert, such as a botanist, horticulturist, or poison control center.
